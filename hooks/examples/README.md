# Examples on how to generate hooks for CTIA

Run `build.sh` to generate and copy jar files from Java source code.

Enter `clj/hook-example` and then run `lein jar` to generate a `jar` file in `target/`.
You could then copy this `jar` in `test/resources/hooks/`.

Look at files in `test/flows/` and to `project.clj` file
to have an example on how to use these.
